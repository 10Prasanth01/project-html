<hr>
<p align="center" style="color:blue;" >An electric car, battery electric car, or all-electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, using only energy stored in batteries. Compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, electric cars are quieter, have no exhaust emissions, and lower emissions overall. In the United States and the European Union, as of 2020, the total cost of ownership of recent electric vehicles is cheaper than that of equivalent ICE cars, due to lower fueling and maintenance costs.Charging an electric car can be done at a variety of charging stations; these charging stations can be installed in both houses and public areas.

Worldwide, 6.6 million plug-in electric cars were sold in 2021, more than doubling 2020 sales, and achieving a market share of 9% of the global new car market.All-electric cars represented 71% of plug-in car sales in 2021. As of December 2021, 16 million plug-in electric cars were on the world's roads. Many countries have established government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles, tax credits, subsidies, and other non-monetary incentives while several countries have legislated to phase-out sales of fossil fuel cars,to reduce air pollution and limit climate change.  </p>
